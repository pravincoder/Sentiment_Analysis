# Sentiment Analysis of Customer Reviews

This project implements sentiment analysis for customer reviews using Groq LLMs. The project is structured into two main components: a backend service implemented with Python's Poetry (located in the `review_scorer` folder) and a frontend application built using NestJS (located in the `frontend` folder).
